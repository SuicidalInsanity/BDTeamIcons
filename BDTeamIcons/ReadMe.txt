BDTeamIcons adds team IU icons to vessels in BDA teams, and supports up to 16 different teams.
Use:
	Press F4 to toggle off the default vessel UI overlay
	'Enable Team Icons' toggles icons on or off.
	'Enable Team Labels' toggles team identification on/off
	'Enable Vessel Labels' toggles vessel names
	'Missile Icons' toggles missile alert icons

	'Do not hide with UI' toggles if icons are turned off via F2 
	'Show Pointers' toggles off-screen icon pointers
	'Icon scale' allows scaling Icon size.

	If multiple teams are present, a team list will appear under the settings. Clicking a team will allow choosing a custom color for that team.

BDTeamIcons will diferentiate between 7 different types of craft and mark each with unique icons - Ships, Planes, Bases/Landers, Probes, Rovers, Submarines, and Station/Relays

Icons can be changed from the default included with BDTeamIcons by replacing any of the BDTeamIcons/Icon/ graphics with a custom grayscale 64x64 image for team icons, or a 32x32 image for debris/missile icons. Note - for custom icon graphics to work, they must have the same name as the image they replace.
